### Analysis Summary

# Flight Module Analysis

The **Flight** module in this application primarily handles the display, filtering, and detailed viewing of flight information. It is structured around several key components that interact to provide a comprehensive user experience for managing flight data.

## Core Data Structure

The fundamental data structure for a flight is defined in the [IFlight interface](src/types/IFlight.ts). This interface outlines the properties associated with each flight, such as `id`, `company`, `flightNumber`, `departure`, `arrival`, `status`, and `plane`.

## Flight Listing and Display

The main component responsible for displaying a list of flights is the **FlightList** component.

### **FlightList** [src/components/flight-list/FlightList.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Renders a collection of flight cards, often based on filtered data. It acts as a container for individual flight representations.
*   **Internal Parts:** It utilizes the [FlightCard](src/components/flight-list/FlightCard.tsx) component to display each individual flight. It also includes an [OpenListButton](src/components/flight-list/OpenListButton.tsx) to control the visibility of the flight list.
*   **External Relationships:** Receives flight data, potentially from a global state or a data source. It interacts with the **FlightFilter** component to update the displayed flights.

### **FlightCard** [src/components/flight-list/FlightCard.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Displays a concise summary of a single flight.
*   **Internal Parts:** Presents key flight details like company, flight number, departure/arrival times, and status.
*   **External Relationships:** When clicked, it likely triggers the opening of the [FlightModal](src/components/modal/flight-detail/FlightModal.tsx) to show detailed flight information. It may also interact with the [FlightActionsButton](src/components/flight-actions/FlightActionsButton.tsx) for specific flight actions.

### **flights.data.ts** [src/components/flight-list/flights.data.ts]

*   **Purpose:** Provides mock or initial flight data for the application. This file serves as a placeholder for actual flight data that would typically come from an API.

## Flight Filtering

The application provides functionality to filter flights based on various criteria. This is managed by the **FlightFilter** component and its sub-components.

### **FlightFilter** [src/components/flights-filter/FlightFilter.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Orchestrates the filtering of flight data.
*   **Internal Parts:** Contains specific filter input components such as [CompanyFilter](src/components/flights-filter/CompanyFilter.tsx) and [FlightInput](src/components/flights-filter/FlightInput.tsx).
*   **External Relationships:** Passes filter criteria to the **FlightList** component or a data management layer to update the displayed flights.

### **CompanyFilter** [src/components/flights-filter/CompanyFilter.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Allows users to filter flights by airline company.

### **FlightInput** [src/components/flights-filter/FlightInput.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Provides input fields for filtering flights, potentially by flight number or other text-based criteria.

## Flight Actions

Specific actions related to flights are handled by the **FlightActionsButton** component.

### **FlightActionsButton** [src/components/flight-actions/FlightActionsButton.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Provides interactive buttons for actions related to a flight, such as sharing, following, or viewing more details.
*   **External Relationships:** Likely used within the [FlightCard](src/components/flight-list/FlightCard.tsx) or [FlightModal](src/components/modal/flight-detail/FlightModal.tsx) to perform actions on a selected flight.

## Flight Detail Modal

When a user wants to view more detailed information about a flight, a modal dialog is presented, managed by the **FlightModal** component and its sub-components.

### **FlightModal** [src/components/modal/flight-detail/FlightModal.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Displays comprehensive details of a selected flight in a modal overlay.
*   **Internal Parts:** Comprises several sub-components to organize and present different aspects of flight information:
    *   [FlightInfo](src/components/modal/flight-detail/FlightInfo.tsx): Displays general flight information.
    *   [MultiFlightInfo](src/components/modal/flight-detail/MultiFlightInfo.tsx): Potentially for displaying information related to multiple segments of a flight or connecting flights.
    *   [PlaneInfo](src/components/modal/flight-detail/PlaneInfo.tsx): Shows details about the aircraft.
    *   [FlightActions](src/components/modal/flight-detail/FlightActions.tsx): Provides actions specific to the detailed flight view.
*   **External Relationships:** Activated by user interaction with a [FlightCard](src/components/flight-list/FlightCard.tsx).

## Loading States

To enhance user experience during data loading, skeleton loaders are used.

### **SkeletonFlightCard** [src/components/loader/skeleton/SkeletonFlightCard.tsx]

*   **Purpose:** Provides a visual placeholder for a [FlightCard](src/components/flight-list/FlightCard.tsx) while flight data is being loaded, indicating to the user that content is on its way.
